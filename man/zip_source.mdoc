libzip (-lzip)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In zip.h
.Vt zip_source_t *source ;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A
.Vt zip_source_t
represents a data source (or destination when used for writing).
.Xr libzip 3
uses it for adding or replacing file contents for a file in a zip archive.
If the source supports seeking, it can also be used to open zip archives from.
.Pp
Data can come from a file on disk
.Xr ( zip_source_file 3 ,
.Xr zip_source_file_create 3 ,
.Xr zip_source_filep 3 ,
or
.Xr zip_source_filep_create 3 ) ,
memory
.Xr ( zip_source_buffer 3 ,
.Xr zip_source_buffer_create 3 ,
.Xr zip_source_buffer_fragment 3 ,
or
.Xr zip_source_buffer_fragment_create 3 ) ,
a file inside an archive
.Xr ( zip_source_zip 3 ) ,
or provided via a callback function
.Xr ( zip_source_function 3
or
.Xr zip_source_function_create 3 ) .
.Xr zip_source_window 3
or
.Xr zip_source_window_create 3
can be used restrict access to a part of the contained data.
.Pp
It can also be used as a filter to process the data provided by an underlying
.Vt zip_source_t
(e.g., to compress it or compute a checksum), created with
.Xr zip_source_layered 3
or
.Xr zip_source_layered_create 3 ) .
.Pp
Sources are freed with
.Xr zip_source_free 3 .
.Pp
Sources must support reading, and can optionally support seeking and
writing.
.Pp
.Vt zip_source_t
is reference counted, and created with a reference count of 1.
.Xr zip_open_from_source 3 ,
.Xr zip_file_add 3 ,
and
.Xr zip_file_replace 3
will take ownership of the passed source (decrement the reference count when they are done using it), so
.Xr zip_source_free 3
only needs to be called when these functions return an error.
The underlying data (file or buffer) must remain valid until the archive is closed.
Use
.Xr zip_source_keep 3
to increase the reference count, for example if you need the source after
.Xr zip_close 3 .
